Asking question: 'what are HSE hours for manhours office in 2010?' in folder: ec6d114f-f54c-428d-8b2c-9af8448f01c9

Answer:
I don't see any information about "HSE hours" or "manhours office" in 2010 in the provided text. The text appears to be a collection of documents related to health and safety, including COSHH assessments, risk registers, and fire evacuation procedures, but it does not contain specific data on HSE hours for an office in 2010.

If you could provide more context or clarify what you are looking for, I may be able to help you better.
